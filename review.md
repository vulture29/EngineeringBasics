#Software Engineering (CSC 510)

__Agile__ is an improvement over waterfall. Continuous integration, test first programming, etc.

- Individuals and interactions
- Working software
- Customer collaboration
- Responding to change

####Design:
- __UML__ (Unified Modeling Language) 
- __Wireframe__ is a view schematic that captures all layout and content decisions of that view (*Balsamiq*).
- __Storyboard__ illustrates the timeline of user performing a task as a sequence of frames.

Design process:

- __Idea Generation.__ What is the problem? What is the user trying to do? 
- __Screening.__ Why is this a problem? What are competitors doing?
- __Design Specification.__ What patterns can we use? What is core product concept (sketches)?
- __Feasibility.__ What would be first step? What are core technologies to leverage?
- __Feedback.__ What does users say?  What do peers say?

Architectural Design Goals:

- Skeleton of system, repositories for designs (Templates for programmers to build systems).
- Concepts and constraints (Provide framework for how components interact).
- Stakeholder communication (Abstract enough to explain to non-experts).

System Requirements Affect Architecture:

- Performance
- Security
- Safety
- Availability / Replicability
- Maintainability

An architectural pattern consists of:

- a set of component types (e.g. process, procedure) that perform some function at runtime
- a topological layout of the components showing their runtime relationships
- a set of connectors (e.g. data streams, sockets) that mediate communication among components
